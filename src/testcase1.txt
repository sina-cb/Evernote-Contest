    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    Gliding o'er all, through all,
    Through Nature, Time, and Space,
    As a ship on the waters advancing,
    The voyage of the soul - not life alone,
    Death, many deaths I'll sing.

    Listen, my children, and you shall hear
    Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
    On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;
    Hardly a man is now alive
    Who remembers that famous day and year.

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?

    Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    April is the cruellest month, breeding
    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.
